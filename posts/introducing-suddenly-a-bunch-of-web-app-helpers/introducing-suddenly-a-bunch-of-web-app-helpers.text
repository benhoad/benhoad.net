# Introducing Suddenly, a bunch of web app helpers

Over the last couple of weeks I've been working on a mini framework for helping to write client/server Node apps.

The framework is called `@suddenly` and is a collection of NPM packages that cover a few boilerplate things that I find myself doing over and over:

[`@suddenly/server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@suddenly/server) creates and configures an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) app with a bunch of default middleware. It also provides a simple way of configuring routing.

[`@suddenly/mailer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@suddenly/mailer) provides a simple way of sending templated emails (for notifications or whatever).

[`@suddenly/compiler`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@suddenly/compiler) wraps [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) and the [Typescript compiler](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to provide a single watcher/builder for both the client and server code.

[`@suddenly/api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@suddenly/api) provides some convenience wrappers around the `fetch` API.

[`@suddenly/flux`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@suddenly/flux) is a simple implementation of [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) that is based on [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

I'm sure there will be more added as I come across more things to that might be useful.
