# Extracting my Markdown blog compiler

I've just extracted my blog post static site compiler into an NPM to make it easier for people to use it themselves.

Previously if you'd forked/cloned the repository for this blog it was messy to merge in upstream updates. Now that the compiler and the blog itself are separate that should be way easier.

[Check out the compiler on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nathanhoad/hey).
