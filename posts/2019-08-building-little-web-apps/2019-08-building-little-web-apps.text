# Building little web apps with @suddenly

When I'm not making games, I develop things for the web.

Recently I found myself needing to make a lot of small apps in a short amount of time. I figured it was a good excuse to throw together some kind of framework to help get the boilerplate stuff done quicker.

I generally use the same few packages when building web apps with very similar structure and configuration so abstracting the shared stuff was pretty straight forward.

## Server

- [`@suddenly/server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@suddenly/server) creates and configures an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) app with a bunch of default middleware. It also provides a simple way of configuring routing.
- [`@suddenly/mailer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@suddenly/mailer) provides a simple way of sending templated emails (for notifications or whatever).

## Client

- [`@suddenly/api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@suddenly/api) provides some convenience wrappers around the `fetch` API.
- [`@suddenly/flux`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@suddenly/flux) is a simple implementation of [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) that is based on [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

## Compiler

- [`@suddenly/compiler`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@suddenly/compiler) wraps [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) and the [Typescript compiler](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to provide a single watcher/builder for both the client and server code.

None of this stuff is meant to be used in big apps but if you find any of them helpful I'd love to [hear about it](https://twitter.com/nathanhoad).
