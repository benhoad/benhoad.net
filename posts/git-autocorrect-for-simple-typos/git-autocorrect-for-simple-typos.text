# Git: Autocorrect for simple typos

If you find yourself making a lot of little mistakes when typing in Git commands then you might want to enable **autocorrect**.

    git config --global help.autocorrect 1

Now when you type something like `git stats` instead of `git status` or `git lg` instead of `git log` then Git will be a little more forgiving. Bigger typos, however, are still handled as missing commands so typing in `git zomgponies` would still result in a `git: 'zomgponies' is not a git command`.
