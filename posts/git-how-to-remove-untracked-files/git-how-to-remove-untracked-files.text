If you have a bunch of untracked files and want to remove them all in one go then just do this:

    git clean

You might need to add the `-f` flag to force the removal of files. You also have the option of doing a dry run where Git won't actually remove anything, just show you the files that would be removed:

    git clean -n

And that's pretty much it.
