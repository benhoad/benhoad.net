November was a huge month for me. This month I did my first markets and opened my [Etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/au/shop/ByNathanHoad). [Node Knockout](https://www.nodeknockout.com) was also on again (and we won again).

This month also saw the indroduction of the character of Coco the Cat:

I've been wanting to do a parody of "Dogs Playing Poker" for a while and finally found the time to paint it:

While sitting at my stall at the Etsy Made Local Markets I was live painting. It was really fun to see people just come up and watch me. One lady bought an original and even commisioned another original.
