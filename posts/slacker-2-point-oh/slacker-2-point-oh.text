I just pushed a massive update to Slacker.

For the uninitiated: Slacker is a tool for posting funny replies to [Slack](https://slack.com)
as your favourite characters.

For fans of Slacker: Lots of improvements! I've done a 100% rebuild from version one.

The first major change is the removal of Slack API tokens. Now you can simply 
click the 'Sign in with Slack' button and it will take care of the rest.

Once you're in you'll see a total overhaul of the user interface. You can now
sign in to multiple Slack teams and quickly switch between them from the 
Google Material-ish Design side panel.

I've added a bunch of new built-in characters (mainly based on the most common
requests that I've gotten). The new character form has grown smarter too.

The last big change that I'll mention is that Slacker now works great on your mobile
for posting funny replies on the go.
